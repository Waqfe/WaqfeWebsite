        <h1>Guidance for Waqifeen-e-Nau</h1>

<p><br>The Waqf-e-Nau scheme was initiated by Hazrat Khalifatul Masih IV (rh) on 3rd April 1987. The literal meaning of Waqf is dedication and the purpose of the Waqf-e-Nau scheme is for the parents to dedicate their children for the propagation of Islam before their birth. After the child is born, the duty of parents does not finish there rather they should make sure that their child’s upbringing is done in the best manner. They should attach themselves to the Khalifa of the time and should realise that they have responsibility towards the Jama’at. A list of guidelines is presented specifically for Waqifeen-e-Nau from addresses delivered by his Holiness Hazrat Khalifatul Masih V (Aba).</p>

<h2><br>Understand the Importance of your Pledge:</h2>

<p><br>“You should always remember that you are the section of the Jama’at whose parents have made a pledge with Allah to dedicate your lives for the cause of the Jama’at and Islam. Therefore, always understand and recognise your importance, and never break the promise which your parents made. In other words, your parents followed the example of Hannah, the mother of Hazrat Maryam. The true sacrifice she made and the example she set is mentioned in Sura-Al-Imran, where it states: ‘Remember when a woman of Imran said My Lord, I have vowed to thee what is in my womb to be dedicated to thy service, So, does thou accept it of me. Thou alone is all hearing all knowing’. (Chapter 3, verse: 36) Most of you are either 15 years of age or older and you have chosen to renew this pledge to dedicate yourself to the service of the Jama’at. In order to fulfil the pledge that was initially made by your parents, you must present yourself formally to the Jama’at and offer your services, once you have completed your education. Already, there is a group amongst you which has joined Jamia Ahmadiyya and so having pledged to serve Islam, is now preparing itself for the great task ahead. InshaAllah, this year, the first batch of missionaries will graduate from the Jamia UK and will be able to fulfil the pledge that was made initially by their parents and later renewed by them on their own accord. May Allah grant all of them the ability to do so. However, apart from those who are studying in Jamia, there are many other Waqf-e-Nau who are pursuing other fields of study. You should always remember that you can only truly count yourselves as a Waqf, if after completion of your studies, you present yourselves to the Jama’at.”</p>

<p><br>(Hazrat Khalifatul Masih V (Aba) – National Waqf-e-Nau Ijtema, UK 6th May 2012 at Baitul Futuh, London)</p>

<h2>Fulfilling your religious duties</h2>
<br>
<p>“To safeguard your Salat should always be the hallmark of a Waqf-e-Nau, and this requires you to always observe the five obligatory prayers and perform them with full respect and attention. You should also give attention to performing voluntary prayers as much as possible. You should recite the Holy Qur’an daily and learn its translation and deeper meanings. It is not enough to simply read the Holy Qur’an; you must also practically implement what the Qur’an teaches you. All these matters are essential to every Waqf-e-Nau. When you observe and fulfil these fundamental requirements, which are essential for your proper moral training, only then you will be seen as a person whose every act is for God’s pleasure. You will then become a person who establishes a real link with Allah and you will be the one who truly strives to acquire His love.”</p>

<p>Hadhrat Khalifatul Masih V (Aba) addressing the Waqifeen-e-nau at the Annual Waqf-e-Nau Ijtema, UK 2015</p><br>
<h2><br>A Waqf-e-Nau should give priority to religious duties over worldly pursuits</h2>
<p><br>Remember when the woman of ‘Imran said, ‘My Lord, I have vowed to Thee what is in my womb to be dedicated to Thy service. So do accept it of me; verily, Thou alone art All-Hearing, All-Knowing.’ (Chapter 3, Verse 36)</p>
<p><br>Explaining the verse his Holiness Hazrat Khalifatul Masih V (Aba) said:</p>
<p><br>“As I have said, I have explained this in detail many times before. No Waqf-e-Nau child should think that if they did Waqf how will they make a living, nor should they entertain the idea of how will they financially or physically care for their parents. Recently, I presided over a Waqf-e-Nau class here [in Toronto] in which a boy asked that if after Waqf we wholly give ourselves over to the Jama‘at, then how will we be able to financially, physically, or generally care for our parents? The raising of this question indicates that, from childhood, the parents did not instill in their Waqf-e-Nau child the idea that we have dedicated you and now you are with us solely as a trust of the Jama‘at. Your siblings will provide for us; you are only to present yourself before the Khalifah of the time and act according to his instructions.”<p>
<p><br>“The very word: مُحَرَّرًا used in the prayer of Hazrat Maryam’s (as) mother means that I have completely separated this child of mine from worldly pursuits and it is my ardent prayer that their sole priority be fulfilling religious duties.”</p>
<p><br>“From childhood, Waqifeen should be taught that nothing is more significant than Waqf-e-Zindagi [life dedication]. Instead of looking at other’s worldly success, or that my class-fellow, after acquiring a similar education, is earning hundreds of thousands [of dollars] while I do not earn in a month what they earn in a day, their thinking should be such that the status God has given me is far superior to worldly success. One should remind themselves of the Holy Prophet Muhammad’s (saw) instruction to look upon one less fortunate than you regarding material wealth and look upon one more fortunate than you in spirituality so that instead of progressing in worldly spheres one makes efforts in progressing in spirituality. Therefore, particularly Waqf-e-Nau boys who have completed their education should, instead of improving their worldly status, make efforts to progress in spirituality. The Promised Messiah (as) expected each Ahmadi Muslim to have lofty standards, so imagine how much effort must be made by an individual whose parents have dedicated them for the faith before their birth and prayed for them.”</p>
<h2><br>A Waqf-e-Nau should also give time in other auxiliary programs</h2>
<p><br>“Briefly, I wish to draw attention to some Waqifeen administrative issues and procedures. Some people have raised the issue that some Waqifeen-e-Nau have a misconception in their minds that, upon becoming a member of Waqf-e-Nau, they have acquired a separate identity. They do have a distinct identity, but this does not afford them any extraordinary treatment. Rather, along with this identity, they will be expected to increase their level of sacrifice. Some people plant the idea in Waqifeen-e-Nau children that they are very special children, resulting in them feeling they are special when they become adults. And here as well, I have been made aware of instances where such individuals ignore the reality of Waqf while making the purpose of their life to be to have the mere title of Waqf-e-Nau, believing it to make them special. Some believe that because they are Waqf-e-Nau, they are exempt from attending their respective auxiliaries programs—if they are a girl, that of Nasirat or Lajna, or if they are a boy, that of Atfal or Khuddam; as if to say, “Our auxiliary is a completely separate auxiliary.” If this idea is in anyone’s heart, it is wholly incorrect. Any Jama‘at officer, even if he be the Jama‘at Amir, is a member of the auxiliary concomitant with his age. Thus, every Waqf-e-Nau girl and boy must remember that they are a member of the auxiliary that corresponds to their age—whatever their age may be, they are required to take part in their programs. And for those who do not take part, the respective auxiliary head should make a report. And if this does not reform the [child], then such a child will be removed from the Waqf-e-Nau scheme.”</p>
<p><br>(Hadhrat Khalifatul Masih V (Aba) – Friday Sermon – 28th Ocotber 2016)</p>
<h2><br>Which field should the Waqifeen-e-Nau pursue</h2>
<p><br>“As I have said, at various stages during your studies, you should ask the Jama‘at which field to pursue—instead of selecting a field yourselves.</p>
<p><br>Regarding the selection of an occupation, I have also said previously that Waqifeen-e-Nau boys should give first preference to entering Jamia and becoming missionaries; there is currently a need for this. Due to Allah the Almighty’s Grace, the Jama‘at is expanding. Not only are new Jama‘ats being formed in areas where the Jama‘at has long been established, but Allah the Almighty is also giving us Jama‘ats in new countries. And we need countless missionaries in every country. Next, our hospitals are in need of doctors. In Rabwah, there is a great need for doctors and various specialists. In Qadian, the hospital is in need of doctors. If there are non-Waqf doctors listening to my Sermon who cannot be sent to these places, then they should draw the attention of Waqf-e-Nau children in their country towards becoming specialists. There is a dearth of specialists. There is also a need for doctors of every field in Africa. Then, in Guatemala, a large hospital is being made which can even be visited from Canada. Here, there is a need for doctors which will increase in the future. There is a need in Indonesia (for doctors), and the need will increase wherever the Jama‘at expands. Therefore, Waqifeen-e-Nau children who wish to become doctors, after earning a higher education and specializing, should come forward and go to that country which is easy to visit. Present yourselves, and then the Jama‘at will send you. Similarly, schools are in need of teachers. Girls and boys can both be used as doctors and teachers, so give this your attention. There is also some need for architects and engineers who are experts in making buildings so that proper planning and supervision can be afforded to the building of mosques, mission houses, schools, hospitals, etc., which will save Jama‘at funds; better facilities will be able to be produced at lower cost. There is also a need for paramedic staff, so [Waqifeen] should enter this field as well. Thus, these are some of the prominent fields regarding which the Jama‘at is currently in need. In the future, the needs will adjust according to the circumstances”.</p>
<p><br>(Hadhrat Khalifatul Masih V (Aba) – Friday Sermon – 28th Ocotber 2016)</p>
<h2><br>We need Waqifeen in scientific research</h2>
<p><br>Some Waqifeen-e-Nau have more of an interest in particular fields, and when they ask me, taking into account their interest, I allow them to study [in that particular field]. But here I wish to inform students that they should pursue various fields of scientific research—and this includes Waqifeen-e-Nau and other students. If we produce the best scientists in various fields of scientific research, then in the future Ahmadi Muslims will be the ones to provide religious knowledge. And where the world will be in need of you for religious knowledge, they will also be in need of you for secular knowledge. In this context, Waqifeen-e-Nau will have secular jobs, but the purpose of their work and knowledge will be to demonstrate the Oneness of God Almighty and the spread of His religion.</p>
